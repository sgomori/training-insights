# Official Ruby SDK for the Model Context Protocol — powers the analytical tool server
#
# Held below 1.2.0 deliberately. That release reworks the sessionless Streamable
# HTTP path under SEP-2575 and changes protocol era negotiation, which the

# connector before widening this.

# as a reviewable Dependabot PR rather than with a routine bundle update.
